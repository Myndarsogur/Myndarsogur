The one who learns best will inherit the house. The first becomes a smith, the second a barber, the third a fencer. When they are asked to demonstrate their skills, the smith shoes a horse while it is galloping, the barber shaves a running rabbit, the fencer circulates his sword so fast that he stays dry in a heavy rain. The father either chooses one of his sons, or, he leaves his property to all three of them.
598	655	-	The Wise Brothers	Tales of Magic (300-749)	650-699 Supernatural Power/ Knowledge	A father leaves his wealth to his three sons. One of them steals diamonds (pieces of gold) that had been willed to all three brothers. In order to settle the case they consult a wise man. On their way they see tracks of an animal & make the following deductions: It was a camel (horse, pack-animal), it was one-eyed (grass is eaten on one side of the road only), it was lame (because of its tracks), it was carrying oil or honey, etc. (drops are seen on the ground), it had no tail (dung on a heap instead of being spread by the tail), etc. When they meet the owner of the lost animal he overhears their remarks, takes them for thieves, & brings them to the judge. They explain their observations to the judge & are absolved. When they are invited for dinner (by the judge) they say the meat is dogmeat, the wine (bread) smells like a corpse, & their host is a bastard. On investigation all their statements are found to be true. The animal had been suckled by a bitch, the vine (corn) had grown on a cemetery, & the mother (of the judge) confesses her adultery.In some variants the judge tells the story of the noblest act in order to settle the dispute of the inheritance. Based on his reaction he declares the youngest to be the thief. Or, the brothers are asked to shoot on their father’s corpse, so that their behavior discloses the real son & heir. In other versions the judge enforces another test of paternity, or he pronounces another of Solomon’s judgments.
599	660	-	The Three Doctors	Tales of Magic (300-749)	650-699 Supernatural Power/ Knowledge	Three doctors display their skills. One removes one of his eyes, the second one his hand (arm, finger) & the third his stomach (heart), intending to replace it later. During the night a cat eats the body parts. A servant substitutes the eye of a cat, the hand of a thief & the stomach of a hog (heart), & the doctors replace them without injury. The one with the cat’s eye can see best at night (always looks for mice), the one with the thief’s hand steals, & the one with the hog’s stomach is always hungry (sniffs & roots at the ground).
