Both of them forget their father & the bird. The youngest son is kind to the fox, follows its advice, & finds the golden bird. Against the fox’s advice he also takes its golden cage & thus wakes the guards. In order to save his life he has to go on a quest for a golden (magic) horse. Again, he also takes its golden bridle, so its guards awake, & he is condemned to death unless he brings a golden maiden (princess). With the fox’s help he succeeds & finally reaches home with the golden princess, the golden horse, & the golden bird. Against the fox’s advice he releases his brothers from the gallows. They steal the bird, the horse, & the princess, & try to kill the youngest brother. They pretend to their father that they have brought him the valuable things. The fox saves the life of the youngest brother (by using water of life). The golden bird, the horse, & the princess identify him as the man who res cued them. (He marries the princess) & his brothers are punished.) In some variants the king is healed by the bird’s singing.

Whoever brings it will inherit the kingdom. His three sons go on a quest. The two elder haughty ones are diverted from their goal. The youngest is single-minded & friendly towards old men (dwarf, eagle) who show him the way & give advice. With their help he reaches a magic castle that opens only for one hour. He appeases the animal guards (dragon, etc.) & finds everyone else asleep. He locates the fountain of life (golden apple tree) & takes the remedy. He sleeps with a beautiful woman (princess) & leaves his name (identification token) with her. When he leaves the castle it closes (sinks). On his way back he rejuvenates (releases) the helpful old men & receives magic objects in return. At home his unsuccessful brothers secretly exchange a common (poisoned) remedy for his healing one. They give it to the king & he recovers. These brothers slander the youngest & the king orders him to be killed. With the help of his magic objects he is able to escape this sentence. Meanwhile the beautiful woman in the magic castle has given birth to a boy & has discovered the name of the intruder. She arrives at the head of an army & demands the father of her son. The haughty brothers pretend it is they. They accompany her, riding beside the golden cloth (path) which the princess has spread, but they find that the gate at its end is closed.
