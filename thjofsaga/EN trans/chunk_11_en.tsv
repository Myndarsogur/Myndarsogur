On the way she meets a wolf. The wolf learns where the girl is going, hurries on ahead, & devours the grandmother (puts her blood in a glass & her flesh in a pot). He puts on her clothes & lies down in her bed. Red Riding Hood arrives at the grandmother’s house. (She has to drink the blood, eat the flesh, & lie down in the bed.) Red Riding Hood doubts whether the wolf is her grandmother & asks him about his odd big ears, eyes, hands, & mouth. Finally the wolf eats Red Riding Hood. A hunter kills the wolf & cuts open his belly. Red Riding Hood & the grandmother are rescued alive. They fill the wolf’s belly with stones; he is drowned or falls to his death. In some variants Red Riding Hood arrives at the grandmother’s house before the wolf. The wolf climbs on the roof to wait until Red Riding Hood leaves. The Grandmother who had boiled sausages asks Red Riding Hood to fill the broth into a big trough in front of the house. Enticed by the smell, the wolf falls from the roof & is drowned in the trough.
